# Movie-App


## Description

This project was built to help movie lovers find the right movie for their taste. I wanted a user to be able to search up any movie or title and for this application to be able to provide them with the movie poster and a link to the movie description and trailer

## Usage

To search up any movie in our database just type in a title of any movie and the application will spit out movies with that approximate title. The search results will be movie posters and upon clicking on a poster it will redirect the user to the imdb page of the specific movie.
